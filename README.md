## organizational tasks

- for example, you created a library to work with date and time in java.
- have sone contributors and users for that library,
- whenevr user witness a bug/issue in the library, he can create an _New Issue_ for the same.
- so developer checks whether it is a minor/major issue. developer can also assign the issue to one of the contributors.
- if a contributor fixes the issue, he creates a pull request from the library and pushes the fixed code to the library. thus developer can merge that changes to master branch.
